This repo is the query framework for our group's IMC 2024 publication: `Exploring the Ecosystem of DNS HTTPS Resource Records: An End-to-End Perspective.` 

The pipeline querys DNS HTTPS records from tranco lists and establishes TLS connections to domains with mismatch IP adresses in HTTPS RR.

### Usage

**Script folder**
`dailyquery.py`: pulls trancon1m records and call `code/multiproc_query.py` to query DNS HTTPS records.  
`script.sh`: cronjob scripts for daily data pulling.  
`script_tlsconnection.sh`: script that send tls connection to server that has IP mismatch.  

**Code folder**
Code folder contains the code used for query.
`config.py`: config data path, async semaphores, and DNS resolvers.  
`utils.py`: class that store query messages.  
`dnsrecord.py`: class for different DNS RRs (A, AAAA, HTTPS, SVCB, NS, SOA, RRSIG).  
`multiproc_query.py`: main query script that uses #CPU cores to query tranco 1m records. Set up asyn semaphore in `config.py` to addjust query speed.  
`scpt_*.py`: other query scripts.
